### Augmented Compass

Giving people directions is good. Telling them to go northwest is helpful only if they know which direction that is. Certainly, a compass can help. However, an augmented-reality compass could be even better!

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* Create a compass app that displays the direction you're facing overtop of a live video view of the real world
* The app should look production ready both in code and in design

HARD MODE #1 requirements for this assignment:
* Rather than just the current direction the phone is displaying, also show the adjacent views as they come into view. For example, if North is currently displaying and the user turns slowly clockwise, North should begin to slide off the left side of the screen and Northeast should begin to enter the screen from the right
* Add vertical tick marks to display each 5 degrees

HARD MODE #2 requirements for this assignment:
* Allow the user to enter a location, geocode the location to get the coordinates, find the distance and the direction to that location from the user's current location and display visually on screen when that direction is on screen
